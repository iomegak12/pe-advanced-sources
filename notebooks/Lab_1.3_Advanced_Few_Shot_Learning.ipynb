    "\n",
    "This lab explores **advanced few-shot learning techniques** for BFSI applications. You'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design effective few-shot examples that teach models patterns\n",
    "- Select optimal examples dynamically based on input\n",
    "- Use contrastive learning (positive and negative examples)\n",
    "- Balance example quality vs. quantity\n",
    "- Apply few-shot learning to complex classification tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** You're building an AI system for a bank's customer service department. The system must classify customer intents, assess loan risk from unstructured text, and categorize financial documents. Few-shot learning allows you to teach the model these patterns without fine-tuning."
