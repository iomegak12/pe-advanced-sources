    "## LAB OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab focuses on **dynamically selecting and injecting context based on query analysis**. You'll learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze queries to determine information needs\n",
    "- Compute semantic similarity between queries and documents\n",
    "- Build hybrid retrieval combining keywords and semantics\n",
    "- Implement re-ranking for precision\n",
    "- Create production-ready context injection pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** You're building a policy Q&A system for a bank. The knowledge base contains:\n",
    "- 200-page lending policy manual\n",
    "- 150-page compliance guidelines\n",
    "- 100-page product documentation\n",
    "- 75-page risk management procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total:** 525 pages = ~260,000 tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** Answer specific questions by injecting only the relevant 1-3 pages (500-1,500 tokens) while maintaining accuracy."
